Add Tasks to Headings — Group tasks under specific headings.

Update Tasks — Edit existing tasks or headings.

Delete Headings & Tasks — Remove unwanted headings or individual tasks.

Dynamic Rendering — Reactively updates the UI when data changes using useState.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
